Snowpack is a great fit for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) projects of any size. It's easy to get started and can scale to projects containing thousands of components and pages without any impact on development speed. Unlike traditional Svelte application tooling, Snowpack saves you from getting bogged down with complex bundler setups and configuration files.

> Snowpack is ‚Ä¶ astonishingly fast, and has a beautiful development experience (hot module reloading, error overlays and so on), and we've been working closely with the Snowpack team on features like SSR[Server-side rendering]. The hot module reloading is particularly revelatory. - [Rich Harris, creator of Svelte](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit)

This guide is a step by step from an empty directory to a fully configured Snowpack project. The concepts this guide covers include:

- How to set up your Snowpack development environment
- Adding your first Svelte component
- Importing images and other web assets
- Enabling Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Connecting your favorite tools

Prerequisites: Snowpack is a command line tool installed from npm. This guide assumes a basic understanding of Node.js, npm, and how to run commands in the terminal. Knowledge of Svelte is not required, Snowpack is a great way to learn Svelte!

> üí° Tip: if you want to jump to the end to see a full featured Svelte setup, there is a [Svelte](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/master/create-snowpack-app/app-template-svelte) working example available in our Create Snowpack App templates.

## Getting started

The easiest way to start a new Snowpack project is with [Create Snowpack App](<https://www.snowpack.dev/#create-snowpack-app-(csa)>), a tool for creating a new project based on our example templates. `@snowpack/project-template-minimal` is a Create Snowpack App template for a simple, bare-bones Snowpack project setup that the rest of this guide builds on.

To get started, open your terminal and head to a directory where you want to put your new project. Now run the following command in your terminal to create a new directory called `svelte-snowpack` with the minimal template automatically installed.

```bash
npx create-snowpack-app svelte-snowpack --template @snowpack/app-template-minimal
```

You can now head to the new directory and start Snowpack with the following two commands:

```bash
cd svelte-snowpack
npm run start
```

You should see your new website up and running!

> üí° Tip: the `README.md` in your new project contains useful information about what each file does.

<div class="frame"><img src="/img/guides/react/minimalist-hello-world.png" alt="screenshot of project-template-minimal, which shows 'Hello world' in text on a white background." class="screenshot"/></div>

Now that you have a basic project up and running, to install Svelte, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install svelte --save
```

> üí° Tip: add the "--use-yarn" or "--use-pnpm" flag to use something other than npm

Install the `@snowpack/plugin-svelte` plugin so that Snowpack knows how built `.svelte` files into JavaScript and CSS files that run in the browser. Snowpack plugins are a way to extend Snowpack's capabilities without having to do custom configuration yourself. To start, install the package in your project:

```bash
npm install @snowpack/plugin-svelte --save-dev
```

Once installed, you'll need to add the plugin to your Snowpack configuration file so that Snowpack knows to use it:

```diff
  module.exports = {
    mount: {
      public: '/',
      src: '/_dist_',
    },
-   plugins: []
+   plugins: ['@snowpack/plugin-svelte'],
  };
```

`@snowpack/plugin-svelte` also has built-in HMR (hot module replacement) and Fast Refresh, features explored later on in this guide.

## Create your first Svelte component

With `@snowpack/plugin-svelte` installed, Snowpack will automatically build `.svelte` files to JS and CSS to run in the browser. Create your first `.svelte` component named `App.svelte` with the following code:

```html
<script>
  /* component logic will go here */
</script>
<style>
  /* css will go here */
</style>
<div class="App">
  <header class="App-header">
    <a
      class="App-link"
      href="https://svelte.dev"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Learn Svelte
    </a>
  </header>
</div>
```

Now head to `index.js` and import it the new `app.svelte` file

```diff
/* Add JavaScript code here! */
-console.log('Hello World! You did it! Welcome to Snowpack :D');
+import App from "./App.svelte";

+var app = new App({
+  target: document.body,
+});

+export default app;
```

Start up Snowpack with `npm start` and you should see a page that says "Learn Svelte." GrewR job, you now have Svelte up and running. Any code changes you make show up in the browser when you save a file.

Image: GIF showing code and site side by side, site is a "Learn Svelte" link on a white background. When the text is edit to add "Hello world" and the file saves, the changes show up in the site immediately.

## Customize your project layout

Snowpack is flexible enough to support whatever project layout that you prefer. In this guide, you'll learn how to use a popular project pattern from the Svelte community.

```
üìÅ src : your Svelte components and their assets (CSS, images)
    ‚Ü≥ index.js
    ‚Ü≥ App.svelte
üìÅ public : global assets like images, fonts, icons, and global CSS
    ‚Ü≥ index.css
    ‚Ü≥ index.html
```

Use your favorite visual editor to rearrange and rename, or run these commands in the terminal:

```bash
mkdir src
mkdir public
mv index.js src/index.js
mv App.svelte src/App.svelte
mv index.html public/index.html
mv index.css public/index.css
```

This means if you are running Snowpack right now, the site is now broken as the files are all in different places. Lets add a "mount" configuration to update your site to your new project layout.

The `mount` configuration changes where Snowpack scan for and builds files. Head back to the `snowpack.config.js` file you edited when you added `@snowpack/plugin-svelte`. Add this to the empty `mount` object:

```diff
  mount: {
-   /* ... */
+   // directory name: 'build directory'
+   public: '/',
+   src: '/_dist_',
  },
```

<img src="/img/guides/react/folderstructure.png" alt="The original file configuration had Snowpack building the directory structure the same as the directories in the project, including root. Now the configuration builds only src and public. Src to the dist folder and public to root." />

`mount` is part of the [Snowpack Configuration API](https://www.snowpack.dev/#configuration). It allows you to customize the file structure of your project. The key is the name of the directory and the value is where you'd like them in the final build. With this new configuration, Snowpack builds files in `public` like `public/index.css` directory into `index.css`. It builds files in `src` like `src/index.js` into `/_dist_/index.js`, so change that path in your `index.html`:

```diff
  <body>
-   <h1>Welcome to Snowpack!</h1>
-   <script type="module" src="/index.js"></script>
+   <script type="module" src="/_dist_/index.js"></script>
  </body>
```

You'll need to restart Snowpack for configuration file changes. When you start up again, if it worked, it should look the same.

## Adding an animated Svelte Logo

In Svelte you can add CSS directly to your component. This step demonstrates this capability by adding an animated logo.

Add this file [`logo.svg`](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/blob/master/create-snowpack-app/app-template-svelte/public/logo.svg) to your `public` directory. Now you can add it to your `App.svelte`

```diff
    <header class="App-header">
+       <img src="/logo.svg" class="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <a class="App-link" href="https://svelte.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Learn Svelte
```

Image: Site showing the new logo

With Svelte, CSS can go directly in your `.svelte` component. Add this code to the top of `App.svelte` between the `<style>` tags:

```css
<style>
  .App-header {
    background-color: #f9f6f6;
    color: #333;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    font-size: calc(10px + 2vmin);
  }
  .App-logo {
    height: 36vmin;
    pointer-events: none;
    margin-bottom: 3rem;
    animation: App-logo-spin infinite 1.6s ease-in-out alternate;
  }
  @keyframes App-logo-spin {
    from {
      transform: scale(1);
    }
    to {
      transform: scale(1.06);
    }
  }
</style>
```

> üí° Tip: Snowpack has built-in support for [CSS Modules](https://www.snowpack.dev/#import-css-modules) and if you'd like to use Sass there is an official [Sass Plugin](https://www.snowpack.dev/#sass).

## Adding a counter to your Svelte component

A previous step demonstrated the built in Hot Module Replacement (HMR) from `@snowpack/plugin-svelte`, but what about Fast Refresh? Snowpack is one of the only Svelte dev environments to support Fast Refresh by default. As you make changes to `.svelte` files, Snowpack automatically updates the browser for you without losing your place or resetting component state. That's Fast Refresh in action. To see this for yourself, go ahead and add a simple timer to your App.svelte component.

Svelte components include component specific scripts in a `<script>` tag. Add the counter here in `App.svelte` between the `<scripe>` tags:

```js
<script>
  import {onMount} from 'svelte';
  let count = 0;
  onMount(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => count++, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(interval);
    };
  });
</script>
```

Then lower down in your component's body, add this code that displays the results of the timer.

```diff
<div class="App">
    <header class="App-header">
      <img src="/logo.svg" class="App-logo" alt="logo" />
+     <p>Page has been open for <code>{count}</code> seconds.</p>
      <a class="App-link" href="https://svelte.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Learn Svelte
      </a>
    </header>
</div>
```

Trying making a change to the code. You'll see the timer does not reset.

Image: GIF showing code and site side by side, when the word "Hello" is added to the .svelte page and the code is saved, the change shows up in the browser without the timer resetting (it keeps counting)

What about other, non-Svelte files like `src/index.js`? To re-render your Svelte application when other files change, add this code snippet to the bottom:

```diff
export default app;

+// Hot Module Replacement (HMR) - Remove this snippet to remove HMR.
+// Learn more: https://www.snowpack.dev/#hot-module-replacement
+if (import.meta.hot) {
+  import.meta.hot.accept();
+  import.meta.hot.dispose(() => {
+    app.$destroy();
+  });
+}
```
